# USSD-Common-App
1. Create a ussd app that captures a users name, surname and some interesting data that can be graphed in a meaningful way. I've attached our ussd API for integration. This app should be written in vanilla php, with no framework.
2. Once you have the integration URL, please supply it to me so I can hook it up to a live ussd code for testing. Please state if you have used GET,POST or XML POST.
3.The data captured from the ussd application needs to be saved in a database. 
4. A basic interface that shows the stored data needs to be created, we would like to see any rich client framework you are comfortable with included here.
5. A page indicating a graph to show some detail of the stored data needs to be provided
